    <div class="content"> I love making new friends. Friends make like interesting. My college and school friends have 
	always been there for me making me laugh and tolerating my moods. They have taught me a lot about the world. 
	There were a lot of things that I was naive/inncoent off and they were the ones who educated me on them
	We were in a strict college with a lot of restrictions but that never stopped us from 
	having the times of our lives. We skipped classes(even if there was a possiblilty of it getting to our 
	parents and get called to the principle office), we snuck outside, and we just hung out whenever we were free
	and we always hung out at the cafeteria just snacking on something and gossiping</div>

    <div class="content">The youth fellowship that I had spontaneosly joined after my 10th 
was the best decision of my life. I got a new close-nit family and I got to be closer to God. These people made 
a better person and helped me to understand the mysteries of the bible. We meet like every week either to hang out we just 
talk about everything and roast one another. We organise events to serve orphanes and elderly people and it was never 
a dull moment with them. I got to sing, play drums, be in a play, decorate, organise and speak publicaly. 	</div>

    <div class="content"> I got my first job as a surprise. It was my first interview and I didn have a lot of preperation
	for it, I just wanted to have an interview experiance. But it was a huge suprise that I got selected on spot. 
	I was nervous at first, but once I got to know them I realised the they were all just few yrs older then me 
	and that it is not a strict work environment, I got to be free and show my skills while having 
	fun with all my colleagus. When work needed to be done we put our all in it but we also got to chillax and joke around with
	all of them including the MD.I got to to have fun with all of them and make ungorgettable memories.</div>
